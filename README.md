<h1>Network Security Groups (NSGs) and Inspecting Traffic Between Azure Virtual Machines</h1>
In this tutorial, we observe various network traffic to and from Azure Virtual Machines with Wireshark as well as experiment with Network Security Groups. <br />


<h2>Video Demonstration</h2>

- ### [YouTube: Azure Virtual Machines, Wireshark, and Network Security Groups](https://youtu.be/enhL0vMoP38)

<h2>Environments and Technologies Used</h2>

- Microsoft Azure (Virtual Machines/Compute)
- Remote Desktop
- Various Command-Line Tools
- Various Network Protocols (SSH, RDP, DNS, DHCP, ICMP)
- Wireshark (Protocol Analyzer)
- PowerShell

<h2>Operating Systems Used </h2>

- Windows 10 (21H2)
- Ubuntu Server 20.04

<h2>High-Level Steps</h2>

- Step 1: Setup Azure Virtual Machines, VM-A & VM-B.
- Step 2: Setup Wireshark on VM-A (1st virtual machine)
- Step 3: Observe ICMP Traffic. Observe ICMP Traffic after reconfiguring the NSG of VM-B (2nd virtual machine)
- Step 4: Observe SSH Traffic
- Step 5: Observe DHCP Traffic
- Step 6: Observe DNS Traffic
- Step 7: Observe RDP Traffic
